	The old format will still work for now, but it is highly recommended to use this format else patches may not sequence correctly. Adding an UPDATE query into the file for setting the sqlpatch setting in site is not needed with this format.
	I'll gradually change the old file names and drop the UPDATE query as time permits, once all ar changed the old functionality will be removed.

	I have discovered that the nzbs imported using GrabNZBs do not have the same release file size as those created by nZEDb. So duplicates will be inserted into the db.
	This can be verified by opening both nzbs and comparing the message-id's. You will see the same message-id's in both nzbs, but the file size will differ.
	The difference appears to be from USP providers, the posted nzb and size is from the originating USP and may vary in size from your USP.
