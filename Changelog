                          fixed bug in grabnzbs not setting bitwise 4, expanded option to add parts to partrepair for any backfill script
                          added utf8_encode to insert for name, searchname and fromname, added a.b.audiobooks to releaseCleaner
                          changed gzip compression level from 6 to 5, since the difference in compression in negligeable but the difference in time is noticeable
                          ***NOTE***
                          I have discovered that the nzbs imported using GrabNZBs do not have the same release file size as those created by nZEDb. So duplicates will be inserted into the db.
                          This can be verified by opening both nzbs and comparing the message-id's. You will see the same message-id's in both nzbs, but the file size will differ.
                          The difference appears to be from USP providers, the posted nzb and size is from the originating USP and may vary in size from your USP.
