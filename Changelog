                          added option to import x number nzbs, then exit

                          changed gzip compression level from 6 to 5, since the difference in compression in negligeable but the difference in time is noticeable
                          ***NOTE***
                          I have discovered that the nzbs imported using GrabNZBs do not have the same release file size as those created by nZEDb. So duplicates will be inserted into the db.
                          This can be verified by opening both nzbs and comparing the message-id's. You will see the same message-id's in both nzbs, but the file size will differ.
                          The difference appears to be from USP providers, the posted nzb and size is from the originating USP and may vary in size from your USP.

                          added option to log 'yEnc' dropped headers, more regexes, added not that using GrabNZBs and replacing nzbs is not necessary, may remove in the future
                          moved misc sorter into fixreleasenames_threaded.py, not sure if it works, changed fixreleasenames_threaded.py to only process misc cat(7010) and relnamestatus (0, 1)

                          reverted all changes to collectionsCleaner, had a serious misunderstanding of that functions purpose, only affected a few groups, look at the diff and see if you index those groups, a reset of those groups affected groups is necessary, sorry

                          you may need to run the patch manually if something fails, the patch may not work with pgsql. I will try to set up a vm for pgsql to test the schema and all queries.

                          Now there is a seperate schema / patches for both database types, make sure to read the readme in db if you are submiting patches.
                          The install has been modified to support postgresql, but it has been locked for now while I keep working on it.
                          Start working on comment sharing throughout sites (ThePeePs will work on the rest with our help).
                          Fixes to par2 and toggle option to turn on and off adding the files to the filelist.
                          Changes to the install page (more checks and clearer text).
