                          ***NOTE***
                          I have discovered that the nzbs imported using GrabNZBs do not have the same release file size as those created by nZEDb. So duplicates will be inserted into the db.
                          This can be verified by opening both nzbs and comparing the message-id's. You will see the same message-id's in both nzbs, but the file size will differ.
                          The difference appears to be from USP providers, the posted nzb and size is from the originating USP and may vary in size from your USP.
