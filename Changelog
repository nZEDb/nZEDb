		additional features, to use the parent nzedb\db\DB class. This is to let me work on
		moving the scripts that DO need the additional features over to using app\models\Settings
		instead and properly separating business logic from the way models get used.

	Mrg: dev-yenc-abstraction branch. This branch unifies our yenc code to use a single class.
		Lithium adapters are used for the available methods, the best available is
		automatically configured as the default.
		  No user configuration should be needed, except for the path to ydecode in the settings as
		before. simple_php_yen_decode can be removed from that setting for those using it, as the
		extension is automatically detected if available.
		  For PHP 7.0 users, a new extension is available to replace simple_php_yenc_decode (which
		cannot be compiled for PHP 7+). This extension is also available for PHP 5.6.
		  Those familiar with Zephir and able to compile the extension themselves, can do so from this
		repository: https://github.com/niel/php-yenc
		  If you can not compile, and are a trusting soul, precompiled versions, in a .deb file, can be
		downloaded from:
			https://github.com/niel/php-yenc/releases/download/v1.0.0/php5.6-yenc_1.0.0-5_amd64.deb
			https://github.com/niel/php-yenc/releases/download/v1.0.0/php7.0-yenc_1.0.0-4_amd64.deb
		  The deb package assumes that PHP 5/7 is installed with the php5.6-*/php7.0-* style of
		packaging it will not work correctly with the php5-*/php7-* style (extension should install,
		but the ini files to load it will be in the wrong locations, so you'll have to correct them).

2014-04-13 kevin
	Add: Massive speed improvement to yEnc decoding (~400 times faster) by using yydecode binary
	  (ubuntu/debian you can get it from the getdeb repository or you can compile it, takes a few seconds).
	  This speeds up anything requiring yEnc decoding, like fetching rars/nfos. On post process additional
	  going through 25 releases on a.b.teeve used to take 5 minutes, it takes about 15-20 seconds now.
	Chg: Change to get more NFO files.
	Chg: Change yydecoder to use random files to help with threaded scripts.

2014-04-12 niel
	Chg: Renamed all necessary SQL patches to work with new method.
	In the process discovered a few patches were badly sequenced so that patches would be ignored. This may be the cause of some problems with (much) older installs.
	NOTE: For some patches to work, the MySQL user must have FILE privileges, and the location of files must be accessible to ALL users. This means that all directories must be traversible, not just have read permissions on the files set for all.
	Chg: Switch patching preference to use new filename format, falling back to old method if needed.

	* New: Added a limited parsing of variables from sql patch files.
	* New: Added a format for patch file naming: YYYY-MM-DD_<patch number>_<table name>.sql The patch number will be used by DbUpdate to set the sqlpatch value in site if no UPDATE... statement is found.
	The old format will still work for now, but it is highly recommended to use this format else patches may not sequence correctly. Adding an UPDATE query into the file for setting the sqlpatch setting in site is not needed with this format.
	I'll gradually change the old file names and drop the UPDATE query as time permits, once all ar changed the old functionality will be removed.
	* New: Added AniDb data to the install process. Patch for current users using the variable parsing feature above included.

	***NOTE***
	I have discovered that the nzbs imported using GrabNZBs do not have the same release file size as those created by nZEDb. So duplicates will be inserted into the db.
	This can be verified by opening both nzbs and comparing the message-id's. You will see the same message-id's in both nzbs, but the file size will differ.
	The difference appears to be from USP providers, the posted nzb and size is from the originating USP and may vary in size from your USP.
