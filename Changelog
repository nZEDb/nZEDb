                          added option to import x number nzbs, then exit
2013-12-02 -> jonnyboy -> moved releases.hashed and releases.request to bitwise, changed bitwise to smallint unsigned, fixed bug in db.php, moved hdtv and bdrip to hd, if searchname contains part# but not s/e numbers,
                          not tv, fixed bug in tpg partrepair
2013-12-02 -> niel     -> refactored db.php
2013-12-01 -> jonnyboy -> please update this file when you post do a pull request
                          changed 4 spaces to tab, removed excess whitespace on blank lines
                          added notices to start.php to better explain the tmux output(iguyking)
                          moved nzbstatus to bitwise, added color to all python scripts, added color to more php scripts, fixed bug in fixreleasenames par2 not couting total changed
                          fixed bug in monitor.php not get correct newest releases name
                          added sort to messages in an attempt to get shortest subject inserted as releases.name
                          fixed bug in grabnzbs not setting bitwise 4, expanded option to add parts to partrepair for any backfill script
                          added utf8_encode to insert for name, searchname and fromname, added a.b.audiobooks to releaseCleaner
                          changed gzip compression level from 6 to 5, since the difference in compression in negligeable but the difference in time is noticeable
                          ***NOTE***
                          I have discovered that the nzbs imported using GrabNZBs do not have the same release file size as those created by nZEDb. So duplicates will be inserted into the db.
                          This can be verified by opening both nzbs and comparing the message-id's. You will see the same message-id's in both nzbs, but the file size will differ.
                          The difference appears to be from USP providers, the posted nzb and size is from the originating USP and may vary in size from your USP.
2013-11-25 -> jonnyboy -> updated miscsorter.php to echo updated changes same as other rename scripts, fixed bug in fixreleasenames filename where renamed to folder\filename
                          changed relnamestatus to bitwise, running this batch will reset relnamestatus to 0, please run 'renametopre.php full all' after running the patch and before anything else

2013-11-24 -> jonnyboy -> added 2 pp panes to complete seq, amazon so can run 24/7 and fixreleasenames.py (all options) so this does not slow down the loop, at least until bitwise is done
2013-11-23 -> jonnyboy -> added file to export user settings using pastebinit
                          added option to log 'yEnc' dropped headers, more regexes, added not that using GrabNZBs and replacing nzbs is not necessary, may remove in the future
                          moved misc sorter into fixreleasenames_threaded.py, not sure if it works, changed fixreleasenames_threaded.py to only process misc cat(7010) and relnamestatus (0, 1)

                          reverted all changes to collectionsCleaner, had a serious misunderstanding of that functions purpose, only affected a few groups, look at the diff and see if you index those groups, a reset of those groups affected groups is necessary, sorry

                          you may need to run the patch manually if something fails, the patch may not work with pgsql. I will try to set up a vm for pgsql to test the schema and all queries.
