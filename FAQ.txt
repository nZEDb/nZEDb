Q: Help, I get empty NZB files in sabnzbd.
A: If you are browsing the site using localhost, the sabnzbd server must be on the same machine. Try browsing from the IP address instead.

A: There is a script in misc/testing/Dev_testing to fix those NZB files.

Q: I'm not getting any covers or x type of release are not being post processed.

A: There is a script in the misc/testing/Dev_testing folder. Read the whole output if you get an error (most people are only reading the bottom part).

A: We will not support newznab + conversions, the script is there if you want to use it, use at your own will.

A: Use blacklists. removeCrapReleases script, size settings for groups etc..

   If your hardware is not powerful enough it will be slow regardless.

Q: I'm getting many releases with unusable names.
A: There is a script in misc/testing/Release_scripts called fixReleaseNames.php
   Do not expect miracles...

Q: How do I run x script?
A: type php name-of-the-script.php , most of the scripts tell you how to use them if you run them like that.

Q: My parts/binaries/collections tabls are very large.
A: Article collections with poorly named subjects or incomplete collections are created 2 hours after the last time we have downloaded an article for that collection,
   if you keep backfilling, your parts/binaries/collections tables will get large obviously...
