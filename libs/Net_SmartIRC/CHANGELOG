v1.1.0:
------
fixes:

changes:

new:
 - applied reconnect delay patch (sf.net patch #883820) from Ronald Hummelink <ronaldhummelink@users.sourceforge.net>
   added setReconnectdelay() method, allows delay between reconnects. This reduces CPU load and prevents DoS.
 - applied autoretry patch (sf.net patch #883821) from Ronald Hummelink <ronaldhummelink@users.sourceforge.net>
   added setAutoRetryMax() method, makes connect retries cleaner.
 - added send() method, can be used to send raw message to the IRC server.

v0.5.6:
------
fixes:
 - renamed Net_SmartIRC_base::Net_SmartIRC to
   Net_SmartIRC_base::Net_SmartIRC_base
   a PHP4 bug made it work, in PHP5 its fixed and doesn't
   (closes PEAR bug #1466, sf.net patch #967067)
 - fixed a bug in _rawreceive()
   the parser checked if he found a colon (messagepart) but +1 was added, the
   check never worked right (I found this bug while porting SmartIRC to C#)
 - fixed bug in _gettype()
   the regexs was too sloppy, sometimes it got confused, this can break easily
   the ChannelSync code.
 - fixed bug in _event_rpl_whoreply()
   on some IRC networks, the channel info in who replies can't be used, they
   return sometimes random channels, this can break ChannelSync code.
 - fixed include paths in example scripts (closes PEAR bug #2042)

changes:
 - applied load socket extension patch (sf.net patch #911993) from
   Anatoly Techtonik <techtonik@users.sourceforge.net>
   if the socket extension is not loaded, it will now try to load it for *nix
   and windows.

new:
 - added objListenFor() method
   it works like listenFor() but returns an array of the received ircdata
   objects (not just ircdata->message like listenFor() does)

v0.5.5:
-------
fixes:
 - fixed a bug in _rawreceive()
   messages were parsed wrong which caused problems with kick reasons.
   (thx to sniper for reporting this).
 - fixed bug in message()
   CTCP ACTION messages had missing \001 at the end.
 - fixed a bug in quit(), which caused quit messages not to be sent to the server.
 - fixed reconnect() bug, it sent the channel join requests right after connect(),
   and tried to join a channel without a name.
 - fixes in ChannelSync code
   When a user joins a channel after SmartIRC, no WHO info is updated in the user object.
   Fixed wrong update of channel mode when rpl_channelmodeis received.
   Fixed bug in _mode() method, which caused wrong handling of mode changes.
   Topic updates are now tracked (thanks to sniper).
   Fixed bug which caused fatal errors with ChannelSync enabled
   (closes sf.net bug  #705269).
   Fixed bug in _event_mode(), unhandled modes were stored wrong.
   Fixed bug in _event_rpl_namreply(), which caused that the first char of the first nick
   of a namreply got cut (closes sf.net bug #747832).
 - fixed bug in _checktimer()
   Which caused problems when a timehandler is unregistered.
 - fixed _gettye()
   It wasn't recognizing SMARTIRC_TYPE_ACTION.
 - removed if(!$obj) check for newly created objects (closes PHP bug #24622),
   required for PHP 4.1.2 compatibility.

changes:
 - removed all irc commands from SmartIRC.php
   they have now their own file (SmartIRC/irccommands.php).
 - Net_SmartIRC_messagehandler class now extends Net_SmartIRC_irccommands.
 - removed the 1. parameter (&$irc) of all message handlers, not needed anymore.
 - renamed class Net_SmartIRC_user to Net_SmartIRC_channeluser,
   added class Net_SmartIRC_ircuser.
 - added prefix _event to all message handlers (needed because of class restructuring).
 - tweaked filling of the ircdata objects.
 - log() now checks the passed debug level bitwise.
 - $data->message will be null instead of random garbage,
   if the IRC message has no colon (the message part),
 - All methods that depend on ChannelSync mode, checks if it's enabled.
 - Optimized the usage of time() for $this->_lastrx.
 - updated the URL of a SmartIRC based bot (atbs).
 - _loggedin is now set to false when the socket is dead,
   required for proper working  reconnect().
 - on a reconnect(), the logfile won't be overwritten anymore.
 - updated phpdoc tags.
 - all access to the channel array now uses strtolower() for the key.
 - fixed typo in function name setChannelSynching(),
   now it's called setChannelSyncing() with a BC wrapper.
 - removed all SMARTIRC_ prefixes for debug output.
 - changed isJoined($channel) to isJoined($channel, $nickname)
   for checking if the specified user is joined.
 - removed "destructors", because they don't free the memory.

new:
 - added isOpped() isVoiced() isBanned().
 - added debug output and debug level for the messageparser.
 - reconnect() uses now the channel key if one exists.
 - added channel key syncing in _mode().
 - when an actionhandler message regex has a leading '/' then the regex is used as it is,
   this allows complex perl regex's.
 - added message type SMARTIRC_TYPE_CTCP_REQUEST and SMARTIRC_CTCP_REPLY for more advanced CTCP.
 - added new log destinations SMARTIRC_NONE and SMARTIRC_BROWSEROUT
   (for firendly browserouput). When the script is called from a browser,
   the BROWSEROUT will automatic be used (closed sf.net bug #708155).
 - added error handling for socket_select() in _rawreceive().
 - added getMessage() to Net_SmartIRC_Error class.
 - added debug level for ChannelSync code (SMARTIRC_DEBUG_CHANNELSYNCING).
 - added filename and linenumber to debug output.
 - added key property to channel class.
 - added to all IRC commands optional $priority parameter with default value SMARTIRC_MEDIUM.
 - added isError() for more advanced errorhandling, needed for encapsulation.
 - added _isValidType() method, which checks for valid SMARTIRC_TYPE_* types.

v0.5.1
------
fixes:
 - major bugs in ChannelSynching fixed.
 - fsocks support fixed.
 - setUseSocket() method fixed.
   If false was passed as parameter, it tried to load the socket extension.
   Also warnings are now suppressed with @ in front of dl().

 - channel() method, getting a reference to the channel, only if channelsynching is on.
 - added ident, host, messageex and rawmessageex variables to the Net_SmartIRC_data class.

v0.4.0
------
* phpSmartIRCclass.inc.php:
 - fixed serious socket bug
   The buffer of the socket got full because only 512 bytes were read at once,
   which caused losing some IRC messages that are comming fast like the MOTD.
   Now it will read 10240 bytes at once, and doesn't loose any IRC message.
 - fixed sendbuffer
   The sendbuffer will only be sent, when the class is fully connected and
   registered on the IRC network. Before if a nickname collision happened,
   all sent IRC commands from the buffer were ignored by the IRC server.
 - fixed socket status
   Socket handling is now compatible with PHP 4.3 dev.
 - fixed $_nick
   When the nickname got changed because of nickname is already in use,
   $_nick  will be updated. (thanks for the hint to Andreas Streichardt).
 - fixed actionhandler ids (unregister caused that the other ids were  changed).
 - fixed TYPE_TOPIC to the right bitoperator value.
 - added a reference to the IRC class in actionhandler callbacks
   WARNING: all user writtin methods have to be changed!!
   method( &$data ) _has to be changed_ to method( &$irc, &$data )
   If you don't change those, your IRC scripts will _not_ work anymore!
 - changed internal methodnames to _methodname
 - changed sendbuffer
   Now it uses configurable senddelay, instead of static 2 messages
   per second (send flood protection).

   react to more than one message type.
 - added TYPE_ACTION for those common /me messages.
 - added timeevents   Added method register_timehandler()
   unregister_timeid() and   reordertimehandler(). Those timehandler
   can be used to call methods in specified intervalls, e.g. for
   timeevents. Added needed class CphpSmartIRCclass_timehandler.
 - moved all IRC related defines to defines.inc.php.
 - changed if() elseif() structures where possible to switch() for
   clearer/faster code.
 - added more debug messages for actionhandler.
 - added unregister_actionhandler() and unregister_actionid() method.

 - Added benchmark system, now its possible to time things for doing
   optimizations.
 - New methods: benchmark(), benchmarktstart(), benchmarkend()
   and show_benchmark() for the benchmark system
 - Added microint(), for getting the microtime as float, needed for
   the benchmarks.
 - Added a couple of log() calls, for different debug levels.
 - fsockets now runs in non blocking mode, because of broken?
   getstatus for fsockets.
 - Added mode() method, for chaning modes of a user or channel.
