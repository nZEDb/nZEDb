Some of the plugins/sysplugins are custom and must be added back when updating.

outputfilter.trimwhitespaces.php has been modified to remove multiple spaces/tabs/newlines/etc,
fixing certain issues where text would be miss-aligned.
Add this before the return when updating :
// (mod by nZEDb) Strip multiple new lines / spaces.
$source = preg_replace("/\s+/ms", " ", $source);
