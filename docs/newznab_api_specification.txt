1. Introduction

   This document describes the newznab/nZEDb Usenet Searching Web API. The API is designed to be implemented
   by Usenet indexing sites, i.e. sites that index Usenet newsgroups through some means, typically
   by downloading and inspecting the NNTP headers. The API is aimed for NZB aware client applications
   to allow them to perform Usenet searches against nZEDb servers and receive NZB information in order
   to facilitate direct downloading from Usenet without having to download any NNTP headers.

   This document does not describe the actual implementation of either the client or the server but just
   describes the HTTP(S) interface and request/response sequences.

   Intended readers are server and client implementers.

1.1 Notation

   This document uses the following notations:

   Parameters: "t=c" denotes a required HTTP query parameter. [o=json | o=xml] denotes optional
   parameters with possible values.


2. Functions

   All functions are executed as HTTP(S) requests over TCP. All parameters are to be passed
   as query parameters unless otherwise indicated. All returned XML/JSON data is UTF-8 encoded
   unless otherwise specified. All query parameters should be UTF-8 and URL encoded, i.e.
   query-param = URL-ENCODE(UTF8-ENCODE(param=value)).

   The functions are divided into two categories. Functions specific to searching and retrieving of items
   and the their information such as SEARCH and TV-SEARCH and functions that are for site/user account
   management such as CAPS and REGISTER.

   Any conforming implementation should support the CAPS and SEARCH functions. Other functions are optional
   and if not supported will return the "203 Function Not Available" when invoked.


   2.1 CAPS

   Description:
   CAPS function is used to query the server for supported features and the protocol version and other
   meta data relevant to the implementation. This function does not require the client to provide any
   login information but can be executed out of "login session".

   Important fields of the returned data:
    server/version                    The version of the protocol implemented by the server. All implementations should be backwards compatible.
    limits                            The limit and defaults to the number of search results returned.
    retention                         Server retention (how many days NZB information is stored before being purged).
    category                          Defines a searchable category which might have any number of subcategories.
    category/id                       Unique category ID, can be either one of the standard category IDs or a site specific ID.
    category/name                     Any descriptive name for the category. Can be site/language specific.
    category/description              A description of the contents of the category.
    category/subcat                   A subcategory.
    category/subcat/id/               Unique category ID, can be either one of the standard category IDs or a site specific ID.
    category/subcat/name              Any descriptive name for the category. Can be site/language specific.
    category/subcat/description       A description of the contents of the category.

   2.2 REGISTER

   Description:

      REGISTER function is used for automatically creating and registering user account.
      This is an optional function and may or may not be available at a site. It is also possible
      that function is available but currently registrations at the site are closed.

      The only prerequisite for registering an account is a valid email address and any server policies.
      It is at the server administration discretion to allow or deny registrations based on
      for example the validity of the email address or the the current client host address.

      On successful registration a valid username, password and api key are returned to the caller
      On error an appropriate error code is returned.

   HTTP Method:
     GET

   HTTP Response:
     200 OK

   Parameters:
     t=register        Register function, must always be "register"
     email=xxx         A valid email address to be used for registration. (URL/UTF-8 encoded).

   Examples:
      --> GET HTTP://servername.com/api?t=register&email=john.joe%40acme.com
      <-- 200 OK
         <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
            <register username="user123" password="pass123" apikey="abcabcd11234abc"/>

         <error code="203" description="Function not available"/>


   2.3 SEARCH

   Description:
      SEARCH function searches the index for items matching the search criteria. On successful
      search the response contains a list of found items. Even if search matched nothing an empty
      response set is created and returned. This function requires passing the user credentials.

      Searches that include categories that are not supported by the server are still executed
      but the non-supported categories are simply skipped. This basically treats such a search
      simply as a "no match" but allows the same query to be ran simultaneously against several
      servers.

      The list of search categories specifies a logical OR condition. I.e. an item matching the
      search input in any of the specified categories is considered a match and is returned. E.g.
      a search searching for "linux" in "computer" and "ebook" categories searches for matching
      items in "computer" and "ebook" but does not search for example the "movies" category.
      Items found in either group are then combined into a single result set. If the input string
      for search is empty all items (within the server/query limits) are returned for the
      matching categories.

      When performing the query the categories to be searched are concatenated into a single
      query parameter by , (comma). For example "cat=200,300,400", which is then URL encoded.

      The returned XML data stream is RSS 2.0 compliant and also contains additional information
      in the extra namespace.

      Response-offset field identifies the current subset of all the matches that are being
      transmitted in the response. In other words, if a search for "disco" finds more matches
      than the server is capable of transmitting in a single response, the response needs to be
      split into several responses. Then it is the clients responsibility to repeat the same
      query with same parameters but specify an increased offset in order to return the next
      set of results.

      If offset query parameter is not used response data contains items between 0 offset - limit.
      If offset query parameter is out of bounds an empty result set is returned.

   Important fields of the returned data (RSS):
      title              Title of the found item.
      guid               A globally unique (GUID) item identifier.
      pubdate            The publishing date in RSS date object as specified by RFC822/2822. (not the Usenet date)
      category           The category the NZB belongs to. (This is human readable for RSS. More precise category is found in additional data)
      enclosure          The NZB url

   HTTP Method:
      GET

   HTTP Response:
      200 OK

   Parameters:
      t=search          Search function, must always be "search"
      apikey=xxxx       User's key as provided by the service provider.

   Optional parameters:
      q=xxxx            Search input (URL/UTF-8 encoded). Case insensitive.
      limit=123         Upper limit for the number of items to be returned.
      cat=xxx           List of categories to search delimited by ","
      o=xxx             Output format, either "JSON" or "XML". Default is "XML".
      extended=1        Return extended information in the search results. (See DETAILS).
      del=1             Delete the item from a users cart on download.
      maxage=123        Only return results which were posted to usenet in the last x days.
      offset=50         The 0 based query offset defining which part of the response we want.

3. Predefined Categories

   In order to facilitate operation that does not rely on a particular natural language, e.g. english
   a set of predefined category IDs have been defined. It is possible to define custom categories
   in the custom category range. Each category is given a range for a set of subcategories. It is possible
   for an item to belong to several categories at the same time.

4. PREDEFINED ATTRIBUTES

   A set of known attributes for items in different categories has been defined.
   Its possible that not all attributes are available at all times. Therefore a
   client application should not rely on any particular attributes being in the
   returned data but should take this list as an optional extra information.
   However attributes marked with * are always available.

   Additionally, not all attributes are applicable to all items. The category
   information can be used to check which attributes area available for which
   category items.

   All attributes are defined using XML namespace syntax.
   e.g. xmlns:newznab="http://www.newznab.com/DTD/2010/feeds/attributes/"

5. nZEDb Error Codes

   Under normal circumstances i.e. when the HTTP request/response sequence is successfully completed
   nZEDb implementations always respond with HTTP 200 OK. However this does not mean that the
   query was semantically correct. It simply means that the HTTP part of the sequence was successful.
   One then must check the actual response body/data to see if the request was completed
   without errors.

   In case of a nZEDb error the response contains an error code and an a description of the error.

   The error codes have been defined into different ranges. 100-199 Account/user credentials specific
   error codes, 200-299 API call specific error codes, 300-399 content specific error codes and finally
   900-999 Other error codes.

   Error code           Description
