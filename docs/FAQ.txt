Q: Help, I get empty NZB files in sabnzbd.

A: We will not support newznab + conversions, the script is there if you want to use it, use at your own will.

A: There is a script in misc/testing/Release_scripts called fixReleaseNames.php
   Do not expect miracles...

Q: How do I run x script?
A: type php name-of-the-script.php , most of the scripts tell you how to use them if you run them like that.

Q: My parts/binaries/collections tabls are very large.
A: Article collections with poorly named subjects or incomplete collections are created 2 hours after the last time we have downloaded an article for that collection,

	// To use a socket instead set MEMCACHE_HOST as 'unix:///path/to/memcached.sock' and MEMCACHE_PORT as '0'.
     define('MEMCACHE_HOST', '127.0.0.1');
     define('MEMCACHE_PORT', '11211');
     // Amount of time to keep a query in ram in seconds.
     define('MEMCACHE_EXPIRY', '900');
     // To compress the queries using zlib or not (more cpu usage and less ram usage if set to true, inverse for false);
