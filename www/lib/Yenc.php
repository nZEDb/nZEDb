/**
* @mainpage yEnc PHP Class
*
* @section intro Introduction
*
* yEnc is an informal standard for efficiently encoding binary files for
* transmission on Usenet, in email, and in other similar mediums. It is
* more efficient than other widely-used encoding methods, resulting in
* smaller files (which in turn results in smaller downloads, which makes
* people happy).
*
* This class implements a working yEnc encoder and decoder according
* to the yEncode working draft specification as of version 1.3, which can
* be found at http://www.yenc.org/yenc-draft.1.3.txt
*
* The only part of the yEnc spec that this class does not implement is
* encoding and decoding of multipart yEncoded binaries. Support for this
* may be added at a later date, but don't get your hopes up.
*
* @section limitations Limitations of PHP
*
* PHP is not an ideal language for implementing something like this. The
* main issue is speed. The first thing you'll notice when you use the
* class is that it is @em incredibly slow. Despite the fact that the
* calculations involved are very simple, and as optimized as they can
* possibly be, the problem is that there are just a @em lot of them, and
* PHP is not a speedy language.
*
* If you want a fast yEnc implementation, you should use C.
*
* So why, then, did I write this class? I don't know really. I was bored.
* It's entirely possible that it could come in handy for dealing with
* very small binary files in a PHP-only environment. Mostly, I just like
* toying with new concepts.
*
* @section support Support & Contact Info
*
* If you find a bug, or if you have a suggestion or comment, I'd love to
* hear from you. If you need someone to hold your hand, please don't waste
* my time. I went to a lot more trouble than I probably should have making

* this class extremely easy to use, and I've also done my best to provide
* thorough documentation, so stupid questions will very likely be met with
* anger and profanity.
*
* That said, you can contact me via email at ryan\@wonko.com and you'll
* always be able to find the latest version of this class and its
* documentation at http://wonko.com/yenc/
