This file details which changes to the code are in which release version. It is a complement to the ChangeLog file which list *when* changes are made to the dev branch.

0.4.26 2015-10-05
Added:
	* Xdebug and PHP settings to nzedb\config\settings.example.php
		Changed default value of PHPMAILER_ENABLED constant to 'false' instead of undefined (it was commented out).
		Changed error reporting level to not exclude any messages, as our code should run clean and therefore *any* messages should be investigated.
		Update your settings.php if you want these.
        **NOTE** Generating messages slows down the running code and hiding them does not stop them being generated, just displayed.
	* Sphinx Full-Text Search for Filenames.
		*** NOTE *** - you will need to do the following to update the sphinx index:
			0) Minimum Sphinx v2.2.9
			1) stop sphinxsearch - `sudo service sphinxsearch stop`
			2) clear old index - `sudo rm /var/lib/sphinxsearch/data/*`
			3) copy updated conf file - `sudo cp /var/www/nZEDb/misc/sphinxsearch/sphinx.conf /etc/sphinxsearch/sphinx.conf`
			4) If you had previously edited the conf file - you will need to re-edit again.
			5) start sphinxsearch - `sudo service sphinxsearch start`
			6) recreate the tables - `php /var/www/nZEDb/misc/sphinxsearch/create_se_tables.php 0 9312`
			7) populate the index - `php /var/www/nZEDb/misc/sphinxsearch/populate_rt_indexes.php releases_rt`
