This file details which changes to the code are in which release version. It is a complement to the
ChangeLog file which list *when* changes are made to the dev branches.


0.8.13.0 2018-12-03
Fixed:
	* Improved accuracy of PreDb matching. Closes issue 2568.
	* Add pagination links in Browse Groups for Alpha, Charisma, Gamma, Gentele, and Omicron Themes.
	* Corrected categories table data for Book entries. This caused books (Comics, etc.) to be
	 listed in the wrong subcategory.
	* New groups not respecting number of days/posts to initialise with and then starting from
	 the first header on the server.


0.8.12.0 2018-11-05
Added:
	* New anime title regex in PPA to capture more titles correctly.
	* Support for mediaInfo's new format in v17.12+

Changed:
	* Renamed 'Complete Sequential' to 'Custom Sequential' in tmux settings, to avoid confusion of
	 people thinking it is more complete than Simple.

Fixed:
	* Make sure newly activated groups have TPG tables, if TPG mode is enabled and MGR mode is not.
	* Fix anime last updated check to correctly return if an update was attempted 'recently'.
	* Correct generic music regex to actually match the example.
	* Corrected counter on predb import daily script, so it no longer reports -1 remaining.


0.8.11.0 2018-10-02
Fixed:
	* Updated scripts in .../misc/testing/DB to use modern require_once syntax (instead of nesting
	 multiple dirname() calls. Also added a new require_once to two scripts that need
	 .../configuration/settings.php to run. Note they will cause an error if the file does not
	 exist, but it should be obvious to the user what the problem is.
	  If any other scripts are complaining about missing nZEDb_* or other constants let me know
	 and I'll update them as well.


0.8.10.0 2018-09-03
Added:
	* Support for PHP 7.2
	 ***NOTE*** You *must* run `composer install` manually as the lithium framework version has
	 changed and your current one will not have some of the new stuff that this update requires.
	  Also, there is currently no version of the php-yenc extension for PHP 7.2. I'm in the process
	 of rewriting it in C/C++, but I do not expect this to be quick, as my spare time is very short
	 currently.


0.8.9.0 2018-08-06
Changed:
	* Removed release counts, for the themes that used it, on group list templates.
	* Strip '00-' from searchname (mostly music titles) when parsing Par2 for a better name.
	* Search for all other/unknown categories (not just Misc>Other) when trying to fix names using
	 Par2.
	* Add categorization for a.b.sounds.

Fixed:
	* Typo in querying database timezone.
	* When fetching RecordSet, check it is valid. If it is, return it;  otherwise return an empty
	 array.
	* app\models\Groups::getBackfilling() to return array of groups filtered by active and backfill
	 state.
	* Undefined index 'groupname' for Admin grouplist active/inactive pages.
	* Admin grouplist inactive page returning active groups.
	* \app\models\Groups::getRange() to correctly handle pagination and filtering by a groupname.
	* Query string for group (in)active pages pagination.
	* Quotation marks around $groupname need to be double, not single. Filtering should work again.


0.8.8.1 2018-07-04
Fixed:
	* Alpha/Charisma/Gamma/Gentele/Omicron templates for browsing groups.


0.8.8.0 2018-07-03
***NOTE*** After updating you may have to do `composer install && ./zed update nzedb` to get things
working again.
Changed:
	* Switched Group handling to use a model. Some functiionality is still handled by the old
	 /nzedb/Groups class.
	* Removed 'releases' column from groups listing and browse group.
	* Updated Lithium framework to v1.2.
	* Removed support for simple_php_yenc_decode extension as it does not support PHP 7+.


0.8.7.0 2018-06-04
Changed:
	* Increase size of 'xref' column in collections' tables due to some larger sizes reported.

Fixed:
	* Replacing last use of each() in nZEDb code. Note that two libraries (forkdaemon and
	 guzzlehttp/promises) still use it however.


0.8.6.0 2018-05-07
Added:
	* tpg' option (to './zed verify tables' sub-command), which checks for missing tables of active
	 groups and creates them. It does not delete tables of inactive groups.

Fixed:
	* Issue where the date after 'release have been disabled/terminated by Releases' was printed as
	 the format string instead of the formatted numbers.


0.8.5.2 2018-04-05
Fixed:
	* Actually merge in the PHPMailer fix.


0.8.5.1 2018-04-05
Fixed:
	* PHPMailer 'Call to a member function isHTML() on null' error.


0.8.5.0 2018-04-02
Fixed:
	* PHPMailer namespace issue causing it to not be found.
	* Issue where sendEmail defaults to using the site's admin address for the 'from' on the
	 contact-us page.


0.8.4.0 2018-03-05
Changed:
	* Updated dependencies.
	* Refactored the Verify command to make some new coming stuff easier. Note: Check command's help
	 for any changes to syntax.
	* Updated PHPMailer from v5.1 to v6.0

Fixed:
	* Issue where updating failed because of git detached head. Correctly detects branch now.
	 Closes issue 2530.


0.8.3.0 2018-01-08
Added:
	* Added an option in settings to allow ALL groups to be treated as MultiGroup releases. Enabling
	 this will make the indexer check across all groups to look for matches. This will increase the
	 possiblity of finding some releases, at the expense of additional processing overhead.
	 ** NOTE ** You do not need to change the poster's list if this is enabled. It will perform the
	 checking for all posters.

Changed:
	* Removed misc/testing/Tests/verify_time_settings script as differences in various settings is
     irrelevant now that timezones have to be specified for PHP and the database.
    * Removed some obsolete sources for IRCScraper settings.

Fixed:
	* Added a check in the connection detection code, to only display "No connection configured"
     message when debug mode is enabled. This prevents it being shown during the install procedure
     by default.


0.8.2.3 2017-12-18
Changed
	* Additional info for debugging timezone problems.

0.8.2.2 2017-12-15
Fixed:
	* Prevented display of "No connection configured", by default, during install process. Closes Issue 2559.


0.8.2.1 2017-12-08
Fixed:
	* Bad logic that caused "No connection defined" message for valid configurations. Closes Issue 2558


0.8.2.0 2017-12-04
Added:
	* settings.example.php has new constants for a maintenance mode. If the mode is set to true
	 then the API/web site return a status of 503 with the message "Maintenance Mode". The page
	 returned by the server should be defined with the MAINTENANCE_MODE_HTML_PATH constant.

Changed:
	* Removed the logged in user check, during API key checking. This prevents incorrect keys from
	being used.

Fixed:
	* Corrected status code for "Missing parameter (apikey)" redirect.
	* Made username check be case-sensitive, as they should *always* be.
	* Not found exception some users were experiencing.


0.8.1.0 2017-11-06
Changed:
	* Composer post install script now copies settings.example.php to settings.php automatically, IF
	 it doesn't already exist.
	* Defaults for logging, in settings.example.php, are now enabled.

Fixed:
	* TMDb not found error. Closes issue 2526.
	* Properly categorize sports related releases. Fixes issue 2527.
	* Quick fix for bad status being returned, when Request limit is exceeded. This will probably
	 cause other issues as it sets the HTTP Response status to whatever code the API creates, most
	 if not all of which are incorrect. This code needs a complete rewrite, which we'll do later.
	* Added the missing constant names in the checks for creating them
	 (app/config/bootstrap/connections.php).


0.8.0.0 2017-10-02
***NOTE*** This version removes support of PHP 5.6

Changed:
	* Post-Processing of Adult releases has been refactored. This should improve identifying posts.
	* Disable caching in php-tmdb library.
	* Remove nZEDbPre2 channel from ircscraper_settings_example.php.
	* Restored sort order of PreDB model to be by creation date.

Fixed:
	* `./zed update` always updates dependencies, even when code base hasn't changed.
	* Quick fix for some XSS vulnerabilities.
	* Make sure page count is set, even when there are no entries. Avoids an unset variable	error.
	* predb_import_daily_batch.php had a bug which prevented matching of timestamps in some
	 circumstances.


0.7.4.0 2017-08-07
***NOTE*** As the latest version of Debian (Debian 9) now supports PHP 7.0, PHP 5.6 is now
	deprecated. We will be removing support for it before the end of the year, probably within 2-3
	months, so update as soon as you can.
Added:
	* New TMDb library code. Switching to use php-tmdb/api library from github.

Changed:
	* Updated steamfront version.
	* Set 'updated' date to zero value when inserting new IRCScraper entries. Should help prevent
      certain errors cause by bad SQL modes. ***NOTE*** Make sure your SQL_MODE does not include
      NO_NON_ZERO DATES or similar options.
    * Move location for predb-progress.txt to the standard configuration directory. If you use the
     'progress' setting for importing predb files, you will have to move this manually.

Fixed:
	* Removed check for tpg in collection_regexes-test.php's template, which caused problems with
	 displaying.
	* Version checks in .../nzedb/NZB.php and .../nzedb/Tmux.php use the XML file instead of the
	 repository, so that non-dev installs work without the repository.
	* Replace spaces with tab, causing steam_app last_update setting to fail on insertion.
	* Check for existing apikey before sending request to GiantBomb. Prevent authentication errors
	 showing up in PPA.
	* Check that '*filestoformreleases' index exists before checking its value for new group
      creation. This was preventing nzb importing from handling new groups.


0.7.3.3 2017-06-21
Fixed:
	* SQL patch 0482 to update release_renaming_regexes entries.


0.7.3.2 2017-06-20
Fixed:
	* Predb entries not being updated because of error in method signature. This prevented
	 IRCScraper from working correctly.
	* Replace overlooked occurences of 'predate' with 'created' in queries. Closes Issue 2474.


0.7.3.1 2017-06-09
Fixed:
	* Steam lookup repeating all the lookups because last pdate date/time wasn't saved properly.


0.7.3.0 2017-06-05
Changed:
	* tmux configuration adjustments for <= v1.8.
	* Update PC Games support, use Steam and GiantBomb only.
	* The IRCScraper code has been changed to make it properly timezone aware. As before,
	 predates are received as UTC/GMT time. However they are not converted using a call to the
	 Database server (whose timezone is essentially unknown). Instead, the timezone of the
	 connection to the server is used, which we are able to set as part of the bootstrap process.
	 By default, this timezone will be the same as the PHP code running the indexer, but it may
	 be set to any valid zone by the user.
      Database changes: The 'predate' datetime field is replaced by a 'created' timestamp field
     and a new 'updated' timestamp field is added.
      ***NOTE*** If you have not already done so, you MUST populate the database's timezone tables
     as described in their documentation. For Debian/Ubuntu users 'mysql_tzinfo_to_sql
     /usr/share/zoneinfo | mysql -u root mysql' should load them easily, this will require
     restarting the database server.
      The smarty template now displays the timezone in the Date header so that it is obvious to
     users. There is also an additional field for when the entry was updated.
      Additionally the pager template is switched to the newer paginate.tpl that I have been
     using in the dev-move-to-models branch.
    * Reworked all Anime release naming regexes.

Fixed:
	* Problem with external yEnc decoders (hopefully). Closes issues 2383 and 2435.
	* Path to bootstrap.min.js in Default theme.
	* Path reference to settings.php for View Logs page. Fixes issue 2456.
	* Fixed some fields in *.tsv files being processed incorrectly because it started with a
	 double-quote, but didn't end with one.


0.7.2.1 2017-05-04
Changed:
	* Updates to tmux configuration files for newer version (2.4) of tmux.

Fixed:
	* NULL value in predb.predate for IRCScraper. Closes issue 2449.


0.7.2.0 2017-05-01
Added:
	* Per poster categorising of releases.
	* Logging for IRCScraper's testing for duplicates, to try to determine why it sometimes fails
	 to detect them. This also prevents the script from exiting because of the exception.

Changed:
	* Removed python module check in tmux/run.php, as python is no longer supported.
	* Updates to scripts simple.sh, simple-expanded.sh, and threaded.sh to get rid of outdated
	 elements.
	* Composer uses '--prefer-dist' for stable branches, '--prefer-source' otherwise. Part of the
	 move to not using the repo in production.
	* SQL/Database optimisations.

Fixed:
	* Properly categorize ANiHLS and HAiKU releases as TV > Anime (please run
	 'php misc/testing/Release/recategorize.php all' to recategorize releases).
	* Properly categorise and rename SDCLiP releases.
	* Properly populate anidb_episodes table.
	* Fixes to IRCScraper class to make it more resilient for those suffing the intermittent missing
	 catalogue error.


0.7.1.2 2017-04-08
Changed:
	* Stable branches now prefer distributed version of code, instead of source. This may help
	 with some local configuration problems, but is primarily intended to separate stable code
	 from the repository meta data.

0.7.1.1 2017-04-06:
Fixed:
	* Added missing field (collection_regexes_id) to multigroup_collections table definition.


0.7.1.0 2017-04-03
	***NOTE*** This requires an update of Composer itself, to v1.4.0 or later.
	`composer self-update`
Added:

Changed:
	* Removes conditional checking for TPG as it is no longer optional.
	* Remove use cases for python backfill script.
	* Remove nntpproxy support.
	* Update fxp/composer-asset-plugin to v1.3.0
		***NOTE*** This requires an update of Composer itself, to v1.4.0 or later.
	* Increase release size floor values to -10/10 in NameFixer class uidCheck function for better
	  mediainfo matching.
	* Improve mediainfo uniqueid matching.
	* Remove git repository checks from Tmux scripts. This is an effort to remove the use of the
      repository from user code. Dev code will still use it for some tasks (e.g. apply tags for
      releases).

Fixed:
	* Fix `zed update nzedb` (PR 2406).
	* Redirect from index page to Install when 'install.lock' does not exist.
	* Update control tool for sabnzbd v1.x API (PR 2398).
	* Make NZBImport check for searchname dupes (Closes issue 2411).
	* Update import predb daily batch script to handle changed layout on github. Also adds the
      date of the file to successful download message.
    * Gamma PC Games view doesn't display grouped by gamesinfo_id.


0.7.0.0 2017-03-06
***IMPORTANT*** If you are updating from an older version, you must update to this version and
following the steps to migrate configuration files BEFORE you continue to update to the latest
version.
Added:
	* New setting (site.main.incognito) that determines if the main page is shown to vistors, or if
	 they are redirected to the login page instead.
      Currently there is no way to edit this in Site => edit.
    * dev-mgr (MultiGroup Releases) branch. This adds new feature for matching releases spread
     across several groups.
    * New setting (site.main.incognito) that determines if the main page is shown to vistors, or if
     they're redirected to the login page instead.
      Currently there is no way to edit this in Site => edit.
    * This adds logging of failed (as in errors, not zero results) regexes to the nZEDb log.
      **NOTE** This supresses warning messages in the PHP log.
    * Update nZEDbBase.php file to be able to return any of the 'constant' values.

Changed:
	* Update sequential scripts for mandatory TPG use, (PR 2379).
	* Improve performance by doing poster check in PHP instead of single row MySQL queries.
	* Updates to simple.sh and simple-extended.sh scripts (PR 2391 and 2392).
	* Move search and user menu to headermenu.tpl in Charisma theme.
	* Update Charisma theme to use new bootswatch library, remove unneeded css and make it use the
	 bootswatch slate theme (make it darker).
	* Move location of configuration files (config.php, settings.php, etc.) to .../configuration
      ***NOTE*** See v0.7.0.0 entry at https://github.com/nZEDb/nZEDb/wiki/Update-Guide for
     additional instructions.

Fixed:
	* Search by reqid link in predb.tpl (closes issue 2381).
	* Settings issues with AniDB population preventing run.
	* Default movie process quantity to 100 if not specified, else use setting (PR 2388).
	* Change checks in NZB to look for false from Db lookup, instead of Traversable which does not
	 guarantee useful data.
	* Fix for uspsetting.sh - powerline segment (PR 2397).


0.6.9.0 2017-02-06
	***IMPORTANT***
	  With the next release (in March), some required changes will be made.
	1) The minimum version of database we support will be raised (MariaDb 10.0/MySQL 5.6).
	 Additionally, we now strongly reccommend MariaDb for all users. It has all the features of
	 MySQL, plus additional stability and functionality (generally faster). MySQL has changed its
	 default settings for a number of features/modes which cause issues with nZEDb, so we will no
	 longer be supporting it directly. If you must use MySQL, you are expected to know what you
	 are doing and maintain it yourself. Check the comparison docs here:
	   https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/mariadb-vs-mysql-compatibility/
	   https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/system-variable-differences-between-mariadb-100-and-mysql-56/
	2) Tables Per Group will become compulsory. Please convert now to avoid problems. The
	 .../misc/testing/DB/convert_to_tpg_alt.php script (with the truncate option) is reccommended.
Added:

Changed:
	* Updates to readme.md (PR 2366).

Fixed:
	* Check for incompatible tmux versions and abort if installed (PR 2353).
	* Predb page link for predb search (closes issue 2356).
	* Work around to prevent some db versions using auto-increment value on an explicit 0 for
	 Categories Other's.
	* Change leftover references to group_id in python scripts and ProcessReleases class.
	* Bad settings data for yydecodepath.
	* Adds releases_groups table to resetdb.php (PR 2365).
	* Fixes typo in ProcessAdditional.php which prevented timeout setting being used correctly (PR 2364).
	* Wrong number of parameters in removeInstallBin function sql query.
	* Bring in b3s3rk's fix, from MGR branch, for the duplicate ReleasesGroups entries.
	* Update threaded.sh for newer fixRelNames params (PR 2376).


0.6.8.1 2017-01-09
Fixed:
	* Paths for install.sh script


0.6.8.0 2017-01-02
Added:
	* dev-releases_groups branch. This provides the ability to have more than one group
     assocciated with a release.
	* Created new bash script to clone and use composer install. The script can be run from the
	 directory you want nZEDb installed to (usually /var/www) using:
		bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nZEDb/nZEDb/0.x/_install/install.sh)

Changed:
	* Sort contents of 10-settings.tsv to make findind incorrect/missing entries easier ;-)
	* Move tmux Monitor pane logging to resources/logs folder, fixes notice in monitor pane when
	 starting tmux.
	* Disable Desura lookups for now, site has changed ownership and is not functional currently.
	* Improve release renaming.
	* Make match_prefiles more precise with match attempts and reduce initial memory usage.
	* Updates tmux configuration for using newer versions (PR 2343).
	* Move predb from frontpage to admin area.

Fixed:
	* Verify settings_table failing for PHP 5.6 users, because of reversed list() parameter, due to
	 misreading the documentation (Fixes issue 2319).
	* Gamma Console cover view not displaying releases grouped by Console ID.
	* Fix post processing for tv shows (PR 2326).
	* Books processing variable incorrect, causing only one category to run.
	* postprocessing_non_amazon and postprocessing_additional PHP Notice/PHP Warning (Issue 2330).
	* Update delete_release stored procedure to use separate queries and no CONCATs for the WHERE
	 clause.
	* Correct powerline tmux config (PR 2346).


0.6.7.0 2016-12-05
Added:
	* Unit test and console command to check that the settings table has all entries from
	 settings.tsv.
      To run the tests do: ./zed test app/tests/ This runs ALL tests, although there is only
     one currentyly ;-)
      To use the command do: ./zed verify settings_table
      This will list out any entries from 10-settings.tsv that cannot be found in your Db table.
      Syntax for the latter command is tentative and may be changed in the future.

Changed:
	* Revamp categorySearch for cleanliness and make category determination more reliable and
	 extensible.
	* Replace reqid.nzedb.com with reqid.newznab-tmux.pw as the default server.
	* Update Composer configuration to use our fork of Git.php.
	* Update simple-expanded.sh. Removes update_theaters as Rotten Tomato's API is no longer
	 freely available (PR 2313).

Fixed:
	* Broken logic in XML_Response class that lead to high response times.
	* Issue with SphinxSE 2.2.11 and maximum return size in ReleaseRemover with larger DB.
	* Improve site/admin site performance in a few queries in Releases and Groups.
	* Change NZB Writing to use XMLWriter instead of string buffering for standardization.
	* Fix advanced search and update related queries (PR 2308).
	* Added some patches to fix some known setting mistakes (caused by missed or missing patches).
	* Verify settings_table failing for PHP 5.6 users, because of reversed list() parameter, due
	 to misreading the documentation (Fixes issue #2319).
	* Verify settings_table failing for PHP 5.6 users, because of reversed list() parameter, due to
	 misreading the documentation (Fixes issue #2319).
	* Gamma Console cover view not displaying releases grouped by Console ID.
	* Post processing for tv shows (PR 2326).
	* Books processing variable incorrect, causing only one category to run.


0.6.6.2 2016-11-08
Fixed:
	* Incorrect SABnzb URL setting fetch.

0.6.6.1 2016-11-08
Fixed:
	* Fix update_releases script not using app\models\Settings class.

0.6.6.0 2016-11-07
Added:
	* Option for admins to delete topics in forum.
	* Search for releases by poster, by clicking on poster name in releases details page.

Changed:
	* Brought in dev-move-to-settings-model branch. This is expected to cause problems as we
	 iron out the final wrinkles. Indexing side should mostly be fine as it was previously
	 merged some time ago. The web side is where we expect most problems to occur. Please keep
	 an eye on your logs and let us know of *any* problems showing up.
	* Add the Imagick PHP extension as a required dependency.
	 ***NOTE*** If you do not already have this extension you *must* install it or PPA will
	 cause errors. Do:
		sudo apt-get install php5.6-imagick (or php7.0-imagick, depending on your PHP version).
	* Switched to using ImageMagick (from GD) for handling image thumbnails, etc. during PPA.
	* Replace duplicate categorySearch function in releases and exclude leading -99 improving query
	 speed

Fixed:
	* Segfaults during PPA caused by broken sample images (fixes issue 2278).
	* User and role category exclusions (fixes issue 2290).
	* SQL patch to ensure the indexer, ppa, innerfileblacklist setting exists.
	* Correct typo causing maxmusicprocessed setting lookup to fail.
	* Fix speed and count accuracy issues with API/Browse functions (PR 2303).


0.6.5.3 2016-10-17
Changed:
	* Remove images/covers support from Trakt (they will no longer serve images after 31st. October).
	* Switch Smarty to bootstrap through lithium instead of just the libraries. Hopefully this will
	 not cause more problems than it fixes.

Fixed:
	* Advanced search link in Gamma theme.
	* Group info included in Extended API output.


0.6.5.2 2016-10-13
Changed:
	* Switch Smarty to bootstrap through lithium instead of just the libraries. Hopefully this will
	 not cause more problems than it fixes.


0.6.5.1 2016-10-12
Added:
	* Add caching to getPagerCount function to reduce load on indexers with many API calls.

Changed:
	* Issue 2263 - Out of memory issue checking RAR files. Add limit checkings to the extra options.

Fixed:
	* Add missing setting for settings table.


0.6.5.0 2016-10-03
Added:
	* TinyMCE editor support to forum and admin->content.
	* Support for per role category exclusions to admin->role edit page(Closes issue #1639).

Changed:
	* Refactored scripts using nzedb\db\Settings class without actually using any of the class'
	 additional features, to use the parent nzedb\db\DB class. This is to let me work on
	 moving the scripts that DO need the additional features over to using app\models\Settings
	 instead and properly separating business logic from the way models get used.
	* Updated NzedbYenc adapter to support decodeIgnore in the extension, instead of falling
	 back to the Php adapter.
	 ***NOTE*** This changes the API for the function so all users of the extension will have to
	 upgrade to at least v1.1.0, or the code will generate errors.
		https://github.com/niel/php-yenc/releases
	* Force php-yenc to use v1.2.2 or later, which fixes some issues with multi-part.
	 ***NOTE*** If you are using the php-yenc extensions you will have to update
	* Restore reporting of total rows to API response.
	* Group audio releases by album (fixes issue #2239).
	* Alter NzedbYenc adapter test to also check for version > 1.0.0 as that version is no longer
	 compatible with the adapter's implementation.
	* Refactor yydecode to use std I/O instead of files, improves performance (PR 2266).

Fixed:
	* Wrongly named autosize script in Alpha and Charisma themes (fixes issue #2268).
	* Prevent TmdbAPI constructor from exiting hard. Instead it now returns null on failure (Fixes
	 issue 2271).


0.6.4.1 2016-09-08
Added:
	* Travis build icons on README for main three branches. Currently only the Installer are
	 tested but we will expand the test suite to include more.

Fixed:
	* Content display for not logged in users in Charisma/Gamma/Gentele/Omicron themes.
	* Prevent yEnc from configuring all adapters during install process, as that would require Db
	 access which isn't available yet. Closes issue #2257.
	* Have the yEnc adapters use the PHP adapter for decodeIgnore(). Slow but it what happened before.
	* Wrap $this->release['group_name'] in an isset check before assignment to avoid missing index
	 error reported in issue #2259.


0.6.4.0 2016-09-05
Changes:
	* Refactored our yEnc code to use a single class. Lithium adapters are used for the available
	 methods, the best available adapter is automatically configured as the default.
	  No user configuration should be needed, except for the path to ydecode in the settings as
	 before. simple_php_yen_decode can be removed from that setting for those using it, as the
	 extension is automatically detected if available.
	  For PHP 7.0 users, a new extension is available to replace simple_php_yenc_decode (which
	 cannot be compiled for PHP 7+). This extension is also available for PHP 5.6.
	  Those familiar with Zephir and able to compile the extension themselves, can do so from this
	 repository: https://github.com/niel/php-yenc
	  If you can not compile, and are a trusting soul, precompiled versions, in a .deb file, can be
	 downloaded from:
	    https://github.com/niel/php-yenc/releases/download/v1.0.0/php5.6-yenc_1.0.0-5_amd64.deb
	    https://github.com/niel/php-yenc/releases/download/v1.0.0/php7.0-yenc_1.0.0-4_amd64.deb
	  The deb package assumes that PHP 5/7 is installed with the php5.6-*/php7.0-* style of
	 packaging it will not work correctly with the php5-*/php7-* style (extension should install,
	 but the ini files to load it will be in the wrong locations, so you'll have to correct them).
	* Update hint for yydecode setting in site-edit.

Fixed:
	* Sorting arrows on admin->user-list page.
	* Update isTV regex to match full season releases (PR 2244).


0.6.3.3 2016-08-24

0.6.0 2016-05-02 updated 2016-05-03
Added:
	* Support for Composer to handle the project and its dependencies (third party libraries).
	 In particular this means after this update you will no longer use git pull to updates then
	have to manually run update_db (that script has been removed). Instead you will have to install
	Composer (one time only) https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#downloading-the-composer-executable
	 We recommend the global method, as we do not provide the composer.phar file in our repo.
	 Then in nZEDb root dir run:
	    composer install
	 Once that is done (and in the future) run:
		./zed update nzedb
	 This will check and install all dependencies and then run the Db updater automatically.
	 You may have to set permissions on .../app/libraries and .../resources/smarty/templates_c
	* We are now using the lithium (li3) framework to handle a number of tasks. The ./zed
	command is an alias to the frameworks li3 console command added in the nZEDb directory for
	convenience (always use this directory to run such commands in your shell).
	 I hope to replace many of our cli scripts with more console commands, to make them more
	useful and easier to remember ;-)
	* Console commands to replace some scripts. Usage: ./zed <command> <options> (without options
	 to get help text).
		update
		version
	* simple-expanded.sh Screen script. This is an updated version of the standard screen script
	with common options already enabled (PR 2113, Thanks to Wally73).
	* 'gn' case to nfo retrieval in api, to be in line with newznab api spec.

Changed:
	* Move location of Smarty's additional directories (cache, compile, and config) to the resources
	directory. These may need you to set the permissions to 777.
	* Moved nZEDb from .../nzedb/build to .../build/nzedb.xml Notice the filename case has changed.
	* Removed some scripts:
		.../misc/testing/DB/autopatcher.php     ... use './zed update nzedb' instead.
		.../cli/update_db.php                   ... use './zed update nzedb' instead.
		.../cli/versions.php                    ... use './zed version <option> instead.

Fixed:
	* Broken links for NFO display on Charisma/Omicron cover pages (Issue 2099).
	* Prevent undefined index 'isadmin' on forumpost page in Gamma template.

	* Links to detail pages in Gamma theme (remove release name).
	* Update sphinx releases_rt index when release files are added.
		*** NOTE *** - you will need to do the following to update the sphinx index:
		1) stop sphinxsearch - `sudo service sphinxsearch stop`
		2) clear old index - `sudo rm /var/lib/sphinxsearch/data/*`
		3) start sphinxsearch - `sudo service sphinxsearch start`
		4) populate the index - `php /var/www/nZEDb/misc/sphinxsearch/populate_rt_indexes.php releases_rt`
	* Check for SD movies before HD ones, to prevent some being falsey matched (PR 2120).
	* Update Scrutinizer file to hopefully fix 'failed install' errors.
	* Reinstate the LINES TERMINATED BY clause to loading data files to override default behaviour
	of only using '\n' instead of '\r\n' that we need (Issue 2104).

	* Disable API access for disabled users (PR 2062).

	 needed before PHP 5.3.6 as 'charset' was ignored.

	 nzbvortex and nzbgetintegration (PR 2039).

	  devs only).
	* Update getID3 library to version 1.9.11.

	* Added missing template file, to Default theme, which caused 500 error when clicking on movie
	  title in covers view.

	* In some cases, when not logged in, no theme is defined and certain links are broken with
	  themes//style... appearing instead of a proper link.

		More importantly it now assumes a convention that themes should use Title cased names or
	  they are not presented as available selections.
		 Admins may rename the directory of any theme they want to omit from user choice to be
	  fully lower-case (the change must be commited to prevent overwriting by next update).

        **NOTE** Generating messages slows down the running code and hiding them does not stop them being generated, just displayed.
	* Sphinx Full-Text Search for Filenames.
		*** NOTE *** - you will need to do the following to update the sphinx index:
