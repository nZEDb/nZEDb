This file details which changes to the code are in which release version. It is a complement to the ChangeLog file which list *when* changes are made to the dev branch.


0.4.23 2015-07-06
Added:
	* Created a config directory under .../nzedb to contain configuration/settings files, so they are all together and don't need paths changing when code moves. I'll gradually move older config/settings files here, with some exceptions TBD.
	* Matching for hyphenated music scene release names. (PR 1719)
	* Support for APCu or APC for caching. (PR 1722)
	* Option to show non-passworded releases AND unprocessed releases.
	* Adding a limit to the maximum number of headers a single group can grab per iteration of the main loop. This allows for a reasonably safe catchup ability on out of date groups, without completely choking the database with one group's headers ;-)
		***NOTE*** this may slow things down for some users of *very* active groups.
		There is an entry in the Settings table (max=>headers=>iteration) to set the value (default 1,000,000), an entry in admin => Edit Site to make this easier will come when someone can be coerced into doing smarty work ;-)
	* Support for post-prossessing to download the last RAR/Zip file, in order to find filenames.
	* Add support for trakt.tv API v2. (PR 1728)

Changed:
	* Updated Smarty to v3.1.27
	* Moved IRCScraper example settings file to the .../nzedb/config directory
	* Ordering comments by created date. Showing newest on top. (PR 1712)
	* Improvements to query caching.
	* NZBImport now adds groups if they don't exist in the database instead of skipping the release.
	* Avoid MySQL caching on transient content. This prevents useless data from filling the cache in place of useful data. (PR 1738)
	* Allow NNTP to retry if compression fails to initialise.
	* Autoloading for Smarty framework uses its Autoloader. Web pages now use a streamlined version of the previous autoloader, which is now removed from the Smarty tree. (Install process hasn't been tested yet. Let us know of any problems).

Fixed:
	* Issues 1713 and 1715. Select all + delete in advanced search.
	* Problems with users being unable to log in due to double quoting in the db lookup query.
