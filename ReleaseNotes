This file details which changes to the code are in which release version. It is a complement to the
ChangeLog file which list *when* changes are made to the dev branches.


0.7.2.0 2017-05-01
Added:
	* Per poster categorising of releases.
	* Logging for IRCScraper's testing for duplicates, to try to determine why it sometimes fails
	 to detect them. This also prevents the script from exiting because of the exception.

Changed:
	* Removed python module check in tmux/run.php, as python is no longer supported.
	* Updates to scripts simple.sh, simple-expanded.sh, and threaded.sh to get rid of outdated
	 elements.
	* Composer uses '--prefer-dist' for stable branches, '--prefer-source' otherwise. Part of the
	 move to not using the repo in production.
	* SQL/Database optimisations.

Fixed:
	* Properly categorize ANiHLS and HAiKU releases as TV > Anime (please run
	 'php misc/testing/Release/recategorize.php all' to recategorize releases).
	* Properly categorise and rename SDCLiP releases.
	* Properly populate anidb_episodes table.
	* Fixes to IRCScraper class to make it more resilient for those suffing the intermittent missing
	 catalogue error.


0.7.1.2 2017-04-08
Changed:
	* Stable branches now prefer distributed version of code, instead of source. This may help
	 with some local configuration problems, but is primarily intended to separate stable code
	 from the repository meta data.

0.7.1.1 2017-04-06:
Fixed:
	* Added missing field (collection_regexes_id) to multigroup_collections table definition.


0.7.1.0 2017-04-03
	***NOTE*** This requires an update of Composer itself, to v1.4.0 or later.
	`composer self-update`
Added:

Changed:
	* Removes conditional checking for TPG as it is no longer optional.
	* Remove use cases for python backfill script.
	* Remove nntpproxy support.
	* Update fxp/composer-asset-plugin to v1.3.0
		***NOTE*** This requires an update of Composer itself, to v1.4.0 or later.
	* Increase release size floor values to -10/10 in NameFixer class uidCheck function for better
	  mediainfo matching.
	* Improve mediainfo uniqueid matching.
	* Remove git repository checks from Tmux scripts. This is an effort to remove the use of the
      repository from user code. Dev code will still use it for some tasks (e.g. apply tags for
      releases).

Fixed:
	* Fix `zed update nzedb` (PR 2406).
	* Redirect from index page to Install when 'install.lock' does not exist.
	* Update control tool for sabnzbd v1.x API (PR 2398).
	* Make NZBImport check for searchname dupes (Closes issue 2411).
	* Update import predb daily batch script to handle changed layout on github. Also adds the
      date of the file to successful download message.
    * Gamma PC Games view doesn't display grouped by gamesinfo_id.


0.7.0.0 2017-03-06
***IMPORTANT*** If you are updating from an older version, you must update to this version and
following the steps to migrate configuration files BEFORE you continue to update to the latest
version.
Added:
	* New setting (site.main.incognito) that determines if the main page is shown to vistors, or if
	 they are redirected to the login page instead.
      Currently there is no way to edit this in Site => edit.
    * dev-mgr (MultiGroup Releases) branch. This adds new feature for matching releases spread
     across several groups.
    * New setting (site.main.incognito) that determines if the main page is shown to vistors, or if
     they're redirected to the login page instead.
      Currently there is no way to edit this in Site => edit.
    * This adds logging of failed (as in errors, not zero results) regexes to the nZEDb log.
      **NOTE** This supresses warning messages in the PHP log.
    * Update nZEDbBase.php file to be able to return any of the 'constant' values.

Changed:
	* Update sequential scripts for mandatory TPG use, (PR 2379).
	* Improve performance by doing poster check in PHP instead of single row MySQL queries.
	* Updates to simple.sh and simple-extended.sh scripts (PR 2391 and 2392).
	* Move search and user menu to headermenu.tpl in Charisma theme.
	* Update Charisma theme to use new bootswatch library, remove unneeded css and make it use the
	 bootswatch slate theme (make it darker).
	* Move location of configuration files (config.php, settings.php, etc.) to .../configuration
      ***NOTE*** See v0.7.0.0 entry at https://github.com/nZEDb/nZEDb/wiki/Update-Guide for
     additional instructions.

Fixed:
	* Search by reqid link in predb.tpl (closes issue 2381).
	* Settings issues with AniDB population preventing run.
	* Default movie process quantity to 100 if not specified, else use setting (PR 2388).
	* Change checks in NZB to look for false from Db lookup, instead of Traversable which does not
	 guarantee useful data.
	* Fix for uspsetting.sh - powerline segment (PR 2397).


0.6.9.0 2017-02-06
	***IMPORTANT***
	  With the next release (in March), some required changes will be made.
	1) The minimum version of database we support will be raised (MariaDb 10.0/MySQL 5.6).
	 Additionally, we now strongly reccommend MariaDb for all users. It has all the features of
	 MySQL, plus additional stability and functionality (generally faster). MySQL has changed its
	 default settings for a number of features/modes which cause issues with nZEDb, so we will no
	 longer be supporting it directly. If you must use MySQL, you are expected to know what you
	 are doing and maintain it yourself. Check the comparison docs here:
	   https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/mariadb-vs-mysql-compatibility/
	   https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/system-variable-differences-between-mariadb-100-and-mysql-56/
	2) Tables Per Group will become compulsory. Please convert now to avoid problems. The
	 .../misc/testing/DB/convert_to_tpg_alt.php script (with the truncate option) is reccommended.
Added:

Changed:
	* Updates to readme.md (PR 2366).

Fixed:
	* Check for incompatible tmux versions and abort if installed (PR 2353).
	* Predb page link for predb search (closes issue 2356).
	* Work around to prevent some db versions using auto-increment value on an explicit 0 for
	 Categories Other's.
	* Change leftover references to group_id in python scripts and ProcessReleases class.
	* Bad settings data for yydecodepath.
	* Adds releases_groups table to resetdb.php (PR 2365).
	* Fixes typo in ProcessAdditional.php which prevented timeout setting being used correctly (PR 2364).
	* Wrong number of parameters in removeInstallBin function sql query.
	* Bring in b3s3rk's fix, from MGR branch, for the duplicate ReleasesGroups entries.
	* Update threaded.sh for newer fixRelNames params (PR 2376).


0.6.8.1 2017-01-09
Fixed:
	* Paths for install.sh script


0.6.8.0 2017-01-02
Added:
	* dev-releases_groups branch. This provides the ability to have more than one group
     assocciated with a release.
	* Created new bash script to clone and use composer install. The script can be run from the
	 directory you want nZEDb installed to (usually /var/www) using:
		bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nZEDb/nZEDb/0.x/_install/install.sh)

Changed:
	* Sort contents of 10-settings.tsv to make findind incorrect/missing entries easier ;-)
	* Move tmux Monitor pane logging to resources/logs folder, fixes notice in monitor pane when
	 starting tmux.
	* Disable Desura lookups for now, site has changed ownership and is not functional currently.
	* Improve release renaming.
	* Make match_prefiles more precise with match attempts and reduce initial memory usage.
	* Updates tmux configuration for using newer versions (PR 2343).
	* Move predb from frontpage to admin area.

Fixed:
	* Verify settings_table failing for PHP 5.6 users, because of reversed list() parameter, due to
	 misreading the documentation (Fixes issue 2319).
	* Gamma Console cover view not displaying releases grouped by Console ID.
	* Fix post processing for tv shows (PR 2326).
	* Books processing variable incorrect, causing only one category to run.
	* postprocessing_non_amazon and postprocessing_additional PHP Notice/PHP Warning (Issue 2330).
	* Update delete_release stored procedure to use separate queries and no CONCATs for the WHERE
	 clause.
	* Correct powerline tmux config (PR 2346).


0.6.7.0 2016-12-05
Added:
	* Unit test and console command to check that the settings table has all entries from
	 settings.tsv.
      To run the tests do: ./zed test app/tests/ This runs ALL tests, although there is only
     one currentyly ;-)
      To use the command do: ./zed verify settings_table
      This will list out any entries from 10-settings.tsv that cannot be found in your Db table.
      Syntax for the latter command is tentative and may be changed in the future.

Changed:
	* Revamp categorySearch for cleanliness and make category determination more reliable and
	 extensible.
	* Replace reqid.nzedb.com with reqid.newznab-tmux.pw as the default server.

	 freely available (PR 2313).

Fixed:
	* Broken logic in XML_Response class that lead to high response times.
	* Issue with SphinxSE 2.2.11 and maximum return size in ReleaseRemover with larger DB.
	* Improve site/admin site performance in a few queries in Releases and Groups.

	* Fix advanced search and update related queries (PR 2308).
	* Added some patches to fix some known setting mistakes (caused by missed or missing patches).
	* Verify settings_table failing for PHP 5.6 users, because of reversed list() parameter, due
	 to misreading the documentation (Fixes issue #2319).
	* Verify settings_table failing for PHP 5.6 users, because of reversed list() parameter, due to
	 misreading the documentation (Fixes issue #2319).
	* Gamma Console cover view not displaying releases grouped by Console ID.
	* Post processing for tv shows (PR 2326).

	* Fix update_releases script not using app\models\Settings class.

0.6.6.0 2016-11-07
Added:
	* Option for admins to delete topics in forum.
	* Search for releases by poster, by clicking on poster name in releases details page.

Changed:
	* Brought in dev-move-to-settings-model branch. This is expected to cause problems as we
	 iron out the final wrinkles. Indexing side should mostly be fine as it was previously
	 merged some time ago. The web side is where we expect most problems to occur. Please keep
	 an eye on your logs and let us know of *any* problems showing up.
	* Add the Imagick PHP extension as a required dependency.
	 ***NOTE*** If you do not already have this extension you *must* install it or PPA will
	 cause errors. Do:

	* Switched to using ImageMagick (from GD) for handling image thumbnails, etc. during PPA.
	* Replace duplicate categorySearch function in releases and exclude leading -99 improving query
	 speed

	* Correct typo causing maxmusicprocessed setting lookup to fail.
	* Fix speed and count accuracy issues with API/Browse functions (PR 2303).


0.6.5.3 2016-10-17
Changed:
	* Remove images/covers support from Trakt (they will no longer serve images after 31st. October).
	* Switch Smarty to bootstrap through lithium instead of just the libraries. Hopefully this will
	 not cause more problems than it fixes.

Fixed:
	* Advanced search link in Gamma theme.
	* Group info included in Extended API output.


0.6.5.2 2016-10-13

Added:
	* Add caching to getPagerCount function to reduce load on indexers with many API calls.

Changed:
	* Issue 2263 - Out of memory issue checking RAR files. Add limit checkings to the extra options.

0.6.5.0 2016-10-03
Added:
	* TinyMCE editor support to forum and admin->content.
	* Support for per role category exclusions to admin->role edit page(Closes issue #1639).

Changed:
	* Refactored scripts using nzedb\db\Settings class without actually using any of the class'
	 additional features, to use the parent nzedb\db\DB class. This is to let me work on
	 moving the scripts that DO need the additional features over to using app\models\Settings
	 instead and properly separating business logic from the way models get used.
	* Updated NzedbYenc adapter to support decodeIgnore in the extension, instead of falling
	 back to the Php adapter.
	 ***NOTE*** This changes the API for the function so all users of the extension will have to
	 upgrade to at least v1.1.0, or the code will generate errors.
		https://github.com/niel/php-yenc/releases
	* Force php-yenc to use v1.2.2 or later, which fixes some issues with multi-part.
	 ***NOTE*** If you are using the php-yenc extensions you will have to update
	* Restore reporting of total rows to API response.
	* Group audio releases by album (fixes issue #2239).
	* Alter NzedbYenc adapter test to also check for version > 1.0.0 as that version is no longer
	 compatible with the adapter's implementation.
	* Refactor yydecode to use std I/O instead of files, improves performance (PR 2266).

Fixed:
	* Wrongly named autosize script in Alpha and Charisma themes (fixes issue #2268).
	* Prevent TmdbAPI constructor from exiting hard. Instead it now returns null on failure (Fixes
	 issue 2271).


0.6.4.1 2016-09-08
Added:
	* Travis build icons on README for main three branches. Currently only the Installer are
	 tested but we will expand the test suite to include more.

Fixed:
	* Content display for not logged in users in Charisma/Gamma/Gentele/Omicron themes.
	* Prevent yEnc from configuring all adapters during install process, as that would require Db
	 access which isn't available yet. Closes issue #2257.
	* Have the yEnc adapters use the PHP adapter for decodeIgnore(). Slow but it what happened before.
	* Wrap $this->release['group_name'] in an isset check before assignment to avoid missing index
	 error reported in issue #2259.


0.6.4.0 2016-09-05
Changes:
	* Refactored our yEnc code to use a single class. Lithium adapters are used for the available
	 methods, the best available adapter is automatically configured as the default.
	  No user configuration should be needed, except for the path to ydecode in the settings as
	 before. simple_php_yen_decode can be removed from that setting for those using it, as the
	 extension is automatically detected if available.
	  For PHP 7.0 users, a new extension is available to replace simple_php_yenc_decode (which
	 cannot be compiled for PHP 7+). This extension is also available for PHP 5.6.
	  Those familiar with Zephir and able to compile the extension themselves, can do so from this
	 repository: https://github.com/niel/php-yenc
	  If you can not compile, and are a trusting soul, precompiled versions, in a .deb file, can be
	 downloaded from:
	    https://github.com/niel/php-yenc/releases/download/v1.0.0/php5.6-yenc_1.0.0-5_amd64.deb
	    https://github.com/niel/php-yenc/releases/download/v1.0.0/php7.0-yenc_1.0.0-4_amd64.deb
	  The deb package assumes that PHP 5/7 is installed with the php5.6-*/php7.0-* style of
	 packaging it will not work correctly with the php5-*/php7-* style (extension should install,
	 but the ini files to load it will be in the wrong locations, so you'll have to correct them).
	* Update hint for yydecode setting in site-edit.

Fixed:
	* Sorting arrows on admin->user-list page.
	* Update isTV regex to match full season releases (PR 2244).


0.6.3.3 2016-08-24
Fixed:
	* Change rt_attr_string to rt_attr_uint as a dummy field. As attributes are pre-cached, strings
	 could cause out of memory issues.
     ***Note*** If using sphinx search the following is required to update the index:
		sudo service sphinxsearch stop
	  Edit /etc/sphinxsearch/sphinx.conf if you made any changes from the default
		sudo mv /etc/sphinxsearch/sphinx.conf /etc/sphinxsearch/sphinx.conf.1
		sudo cp /var/www/nZEDb/misc/sphinxsearch/sphinx.conf /etc/sphinxsearch/sphinx.conf
		sudo service sphinxsearch start
		php misc/sphinxsearch/populate_rt_indexes.php releases_rt


0.6.3.2 2016-08-15
Fixed:
	* Fix incorrect column name in patch 447.


0.6.3.1 2016-08-08
Changes:
	* Make themes more lower resolution/mobile devices friendly.
	* Improve JSON Response from API/RSS by basing it off of XML Response (PR 2194).

Fixed:
	* Add required rt_att directive for sphinx v2.2.11
		Note: if using sphinx search the following is required to update the index
		sudo service sphinxsearch stop
		sudo mv /etc/sphinxsearch/sphinx.conf /etc/sphinxsearch/sphinx.conf.1
		sudo cp /var/www/nZEDb/misc/sphinxsearch/sphinx.conf /etc/sphinxsearch/sphinx.conf
		sudo service sphinxsearch start
		php misc/sphinxsearch/populate_rt_indexes.php releases_rt

	* Add missing glyphicons-halflings images to shared/img folder and adjust CSS of Gamma theme.
	* Replace somehow reverted icon- with font-awesome versions in viewmoviefull and xxx tpl files in Alpha theme.
	* Install's bootstrap process that prevent use of Settings table before it is created.
	* User cart operations in themes.
	* Adjustments to DbUpdate class to be sure Settings instance is there when needed.
	* Add checks for tv attributes in XML_Response.php (Fixes issue 2225).


0.6.3.0 2016-08-01

	* UHD subcategories to Movies, TV and XXX categories.
	 ***Note*** run recategorize script to populate the new categories
		php misc/testing/Release/recategorize.php all

Changes:
	* Update Omicron CSS/JS to AdminLTE 2.3.5
	* Update profile edit pages in Charisma/Gentele/Omicron themes.
	* Add group parameter support to api search function (Closes issue 2195).
	* Use max headers iteration site setting if set (or max of 1,000,000 if not set) during
	  multiprocessing safe binaries This will ensure we don't queue too many jobs in one loop if
	  you are behind on updating and is consistant with other update binaries methods.

Fixed:
	* Reset user grabs and api requests in Charisma/Gamma/Gentele/Omicron themes (Fixes issue 2206).
	* Remove searchname after the guid when calling release details page in
	 Charisma/Gamma/Gentele/Omicron themes.

	* Add lithium libraries bootstrap for Admin pages (Fixes issue 2215).

0.6.2.4 2016-07-08
Changes:
	* Refactored all scripts to use the app/extensions/util/Versions class instead of the older
	 nzedb\utility\Versions.


0.6.2.3 2016-07-07
Changes:
	* Updated fxp/composer-asset-plugin dependency to v1.2.0

Fixes:
	* Create new bootstrap file (.../bootstrap.php) to enable nzedb and lithium's app libraries
	 to load together. This fixes #2205.
	  New files should use it as the base require_once instead of indexer.php. Old files will be
	 converted over when it is convenient.


0.6.2.2 2016-07-06
Fixes:
	* Other category not available on new installs, due to insert query still using 'category' table.
	* Malformed RSS for my movies and my shows RSS.

0.6.0.1 2016-05-07
Fixed:
	* Db entries in settings for ReCaptcha.

0.6.0 2016-05-02 updated 2016-05-03
Added:
	* Support for Composer to handle the project and its dependencies (third party libraries).
	 In particular this means after this update you will no longer use git pull to updates then
	have to manually run update_db (that script has been removed). Instead you will have to install
	Composer (one time only) https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#downloading-the-composer-executable
	 We recommend the global method, as we do not provide the composer.phar file in our repo.
	 Then in nZEDb root dir run:
	    composer install
	 Once that is done (and in the future) run:
		./zed update nzedb
	 This will check and install all dependencies and then run the Db updater automatically.
	 You may have to set permissions on .../app/libraries and .../resources/smarty/templates_c
	* We are now using the lithium (li3) framework to handle a number of tasks. The ./zed
	command is an alias to the frameworks li3 console command added in the nZEDb directory for
	convenience (always use this directory to run such commands in your shell).
	 I hope to replace many of our cli scripts with more console commands, to make them more
	useful and easier to remember ;-)
	* Console commands to replace some scripts. Usage: ./zed <command> <options> (without options
	 to get help text).
		update
		version
	* simple-expanded.sh Screen script. This is an updated version of the standard screen script
	with common options already enabled (PR 2113, Thanks to Wally73).
	* 'gn' case to nfo retrieval in api, to be in line with newznab api spec.

Changed:
	* Move location of Smarty's additional directories (cache, compile, and config) to the resources
	directory. These may need you to set the permissions to 777.
	* Moved nZEDb from .../nzedb/build to .../build/nzedb.xml Notice the filename case has changed.
	* Removed some scripts:
		.../misc/testing/DB/autopatcher.php     ... use './zed update nzedb' instead.
		.../cli/update_db.php                   ... use './zed update nzedb' instead.
		.../cli/versions.php                    ... use './zed version <option> instead.

Fixed:
	* Broken links for NFO display on Charisma/Omicron cover pages (Issue 2099).
	* Prevent undefined index 'isadmin' on forumpost page in Gamma template.
	* NFO display on coverpages in Light/Default themes (ssue #2099).
	* Division by zero error when viewing filelist in Alpha and Default themes.
	* Filelist display in all of the themes, reduce overhead in NZB class related to segments array.
	* Links to detail pages in Gamma theme (remove release name).
	* Update sphinx releases_rt index when release files are added.
		*** NOTE *** - you will need to do the following to update the sphinx index:
		1) stop sphinxsearch - `sudo service sphinxsearch stop`
		2) clear old index - `sudo rm /var/lib/sphinxsearch/data/*`
		3) start sphinxsearch - `sudo service sphinxsearch start`
		4) populate the index - `php /var/www/nZEDb/misc/sphinxsearch/populate_rt_indexes.php releases_rt`
	* Check for SD movies before HD ones, to prevent some being falsey matched (PR 2120).
	* Update Scrutinizer file to hopefully fix 'failed install' errors.
	* Reinstate the LINES TERMINATED BY clause to loading data files to override default behaviour
	of only using '\n' instead of '\r\n' that we need (Issue 2104).

	 nzbvortex and nzbgetintegration (PR 2039).

	  devs only).

	  they are not presented as available selections.
		 Admins may rename the directory of any theme they want to omit from user choice to be
	  fully lower-case (the change must be commited to prevent overwriting by next update).

        **NOTE** Generating messages slows down the running code and hiding them does not stop them being generated, just displayed.
	* Sphinx Full-Text Search for Filenames.
		*** NOTE *** - you will need to do the following to update the sphinx index:

	* Support for APCu or APC for caching. (PR 1722)
	* Option to show non-passworded releases AND unprocessed releases.
	* Adding a limit to the maximum number of headers a single group can grab per iteration of the main loop. This allows for a reasonably safe catchup ability on out of date groups, without completely choking the database with one group's headers ;-)
		***NOTE*** this may slow things down for some users of *very* active groups.
		There is an entry in the Settings table (max=>headers=>iteration) to set the value (default 1,000,000), an entry in admin => Edit Site to make this easier will come when someone can be coerced into doing smarty work ;-)
