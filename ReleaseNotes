This file details which changes to the code are in which release version. It is a complement to the ChangeLog file which list *when* changes are made to the dev branch.

0.6.0.1 2016-05-07
Fixed:
	* Db entries in settings for ReCaptcha.

0.6.0 2016-05-02 updated 2016-05-03
Added:
	* Support for Composer to handle the project and its dependencies (third party libraries).
	 In particular this means after this update you will no longer use git pull to updates then
	have to manually run update_db (that script has been removed). Instead you will have to install
	Composer (one time only) https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#downloading-the-composer-executable
	 We recommend the global method, as we do not provide the composer.phar file in our repo.
	 Then in nZEDb root dir run:
	    composer install
	 Once that is done (and in the future) run:
		./zed update nzedb
	 This will check and install all dependencies and then run the Db updater automatically.
	 You may have to set permissions on .../app/libraries and .../resources/smarty/templates_c
	* We are now using the lithium (li3) framework to handle a number of tasks. The ./zed
	command is an alias to the frameworks li3 console command added in the nZEDb directory for
	convenience (always use this directory to run such commands in your shell).
	 I hope to replace many of our cli scripts with more console commands, to make them more
	useful and easier to remember ;-)
	* Console commands to replace some scripts. Usage: ./zed <command> <options> (without options
	 to get help text).
		update
		version
	* simple-expanded.sh Screen script. This is an updated version of the standard screen script
	with common options already enabled (PR 2113, Thanks to Wally73).
	* 'gn' case to nfo retrieval in api, to be in line with newznab api spec.

Changed:
	* Move location of Smarty's additional directories (cache, compile, and config) to the resources
	directory. These may need you to set the permissions to 777.
	* Moved nZEDb from .../nzedb/build to .../build/nzedb.xml Notice the filename case has changed.
	* Removed some scripts:
		.../misc/testing/DB/autopatcher.php     ... use './zed update nzedb' instead.
		.../cli/update_db.php                   ... use './zed update nzedb' instead.
		.../cli/versions.php                    ... use './zed version <option> instead.

Fixed:
	* Broken links for NFO display on Charisma/Omicron cover pages (Issue 2099).
	* Prevent undefined index 'isadmin' on forumpost page in Gamma template.
	* NFO display on coverpages in Light/Default themes (ssue #2099).
	* Division by zero error when viewing filelist in Alpha and Default themes.
	* Filelist display in all of the themes, reduce overhead in NZB class related to segments array.
	* Links to detail pages in Gamma theme (remove release name).
	* Update sphinx releases_rt index when release files are added.
		*** NOTE *** - you will need to do the following to update the sphinx index:
		1) stop sphinxsearch - `sudo service sphinxsearch stop`
		2) clear old index - `sudo rm /var/lib/sphinxsearch/data/*`
		3) start sphinxsearch - `sudo service sphinxsearch start`
		4) populate the index - `php /var/www/nZEDb/misc/sphinxsearch/populate_rt_indexes.php releases_rt`
	* Check for SD movies before HD ones, to prevent some being falsey matched (PR 2120).
	* Update Scrutinizer file to hopefully fix 'failed install' errors.
	* Reinstate the LINES TERMINATED BY clause to loading data files to override default behaviour
	of only using '\n' instead of '\r\n' that we need (Issue 2104).


0.5.5 2016-04-04
Added:

**IMPORTANT** Be aware that for the this update (April) the stable branch will no longer be the

	 designers should never use the numbers directly, they are subject to change at any time.

	* Disable API access for disabled users (PR 2062).

	 needed before PHP 5.3.6 as 'charset' was ignored.

Fixed:

	 nzbvortex and nzbgetintegration (PR 2039).

	  devs only).
	* Update getID3 library to version 1.9.11.

	  title in covers view.

		More importantly it now assumes a convention that themes should use Title cased names or
	  they are not presented as available selections.
		 Admins may rename the directory of any theme they want to omit from user choice to be
	  fully lower-case (the change must be commited to prevent overwriting by next update).
		 This change will be the basis for further improvements in time.

		***	Note: We found a bug dating back to the beginning that caused bad titles to be inserted into the TvRage table

		Update your settings.php if you want these.
        **NOTE** Generating messages slows down the running code and hiding them does not stop them being generated, just displayed.
	* Sphinx Full-Text Search for Filenames.
		*** NOTE *** - you will need to do the following to update the sphinx index:
			0) Minimum Sphinx v2.2.9
			1) stop sphinxsearch - `sudo service sphinxsearch stop`

		https://gist.github.com/kevinlekiller/233052179689512a5f58

0.4.23 2015-07-06

		There is an entry in the Settings table (max=>headers=>iteration) to set the value (default 1,000,000), an entry in admin => Edit Site to make this easier will come when someone can be coerced into doing smarty work ;-)
